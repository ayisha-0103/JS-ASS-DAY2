    <h2><b>substring:</b></h2>
    <p>The substring() method accepts two parameters: startIndexand endIndex:
        
        The startIndex specifies the index of the first character to include in the returned substring.
        The endIndex determines the first character to exclude from the returned substring
        . In other words, the returned substring doesnâ€™t include the character at the endIndex.</br>
        <h2><b>splice</b></h2>

        The splice() method adds/removes items to/from an array, and returns the removed item(s). </br>
        <h2><b>Replace</b></h2>
        The replace() method returns a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The pattern can be a string or a RegExp, and the replacement can be a string or a function to be called for each match. If pattern is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.

        The original string is left unchanged.
